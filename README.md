# Repository of Python Projetcs
#This repository is a collection of my personal python projects (organized newest to oldest).

#The file named Matplotlib Spreadsheet is a program that I made to create a scatter plot with a line of best fit, similiar to excel or google sheets. This program is plotting the absorbance vs the concentration of caffeine. The program finds the slope of the best fit line. Knowing Beer's Law is A'_caf= Îµ'_caf l C'_caf. The slope of the line is the extinction coefficient of the caffeine.

#The Orbit Propagator program simulates the motion of a single charged particle orbiting a stationary particle in two dimensions located at x= 0m and y= 1m. This simulation simulates 10 seconds of the particle's motion. The acceleration, velocity and position of the second particle (particle b) are updated a timestep of 10^-6 seconds based on the initial values which are updated after each timestep.

#The Trajectory Propagator follows the motion of a single particle in two dimensions. This is also based on an initial velocity and position, which are each updated afer a timestep of 10^-6 seconds within 10 seconds as well. This also uses Euler's method.
